# Conway's Game of Life using WebGPU

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life using WebGPU. It is based on the brilliant [WebGPU tutorial by Google](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/your-first-webgpu-app#0).

To use this, you need a browser that supports WebGPU. Currently, this means you need to use Chrome Canary with the `--enable-unsafe-webgpu` flag. You can also use Firefox Nightly with the `dom.webgpu.enabled` flag set to `true`.

Just open `index.html` in your browser and you should see the game of life running.
